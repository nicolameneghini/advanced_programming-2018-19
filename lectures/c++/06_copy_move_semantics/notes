class Foo{

  Foo() = default;
  Foo(const Foo &) = default;
  Foo&operator= (const Foo&) = default; -> until here: copy contructor
  Foo(Foo &&) = default;
  Fooo operator(Foo&)=default; -> move constructors

}


If I run the program I get an unknown symbol. If I build a constructro without culybraces (like x5), the
variable is not initialized.

last line doesn't compile because I deleted the copy constructor

the output is: uninitialized: random value;
               initialized: does what I said;
               uninitialized: random value;


--- 03 ---
in struct X the default constructor is automatically built as commented
in struct Y the constructor is a custom one

see the difference between initialized and not
