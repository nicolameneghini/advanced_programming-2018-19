a linked list is a sequence of blocks in the heap
every block contains a pointer to the following one (the last points to null pointer)
This is single linked list

There is also double linked list where the pointer is in both directions

Data hiding: the interal technicalities thorough which the list links are not provided to the user
In this way I can work in a multi thread environment more easiliy

-----

iterator is a generalized type of pointer
T& operator*()
T&  operator->()

iterator operator++() returns ++it
iterator operator++(int) returns it++
